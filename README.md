# financial_data_security
* This repository demonstrates advanced concepts and implementation strategies for data security in the financial industry.
* Includes documentation for encryption, multi-factor authentication, vulnerability assessments, data backup/recovery, and incident response planning. 

# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* pycryptodome library (install using `pip install pycryptodome`)
* pyotp library (install using `pip install pyotp`)
* requests library (install using `pip install requests`)
* cryptography library (install using `pip install cryptography`)

# What does it do?
* The encryptor demonstrates encryption and decryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm.
* The multi-factor authenticator implements two-factor authentication (2FA) using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).
* The security tester performs basic security checks on a given URL and detects common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Insecure Direct Object References.
* The backup recovery tool automates the process of securely backing up data to an external storage system while ensuring encryption, integrity, and easy data restoration.
* The indecent response tool includes a general framework for an indecent response plan for financial companies.
* The indecent response tool also includes code which automates the process of sending email notifications to key stakeholders during a security incident.

# How does it work?
* Information regarding further details of each directory have been included in seperate README files.
* This was done to ensure organization and legibility throughout the repository.
* Each respective README includes details on directory usage, examples of succesful/failed inputs, along with important notes, if necessary.
