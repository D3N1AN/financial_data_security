# Incident Detection:

* Define financial-specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
* Utilize specialized security monitoring tools and processes designed for financial systems and networks.
* Establish procedures for monitoring financial transactions, unusual account activities, and access to sensitive financial data.

# Response Coordination:

* Establish an incident response team consisting of members with expertise in financial operations, IT, legal, compliance, and public relations.
* Define roles and responsibilities of team members specific to financial incident response.
* Establish clear communication channels and escalation procedures to ensure effective coordination and decision-making during incidents.
* Develop a communication plan to ensure timely and accurate communication with internal stakeholders, external partners, regulatory authorities, and affected customers.

# Containment:

* Activate incident response procedures promptly to contain the impact of the incident.
* Isolate affected systems or networks to prevent further compromise and limit the scope of the incident.
* Implement access restrictions and controls to prevent unauthorized access to financial systems and data.

# Eradication:

* Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root cause(s) of the incident.
* Remediate vulnerabilities and address underlying issues identified during the investigation.
* Remove malicious code, malware, or unauthorized access points from affected systems.

# Recovery:

* Restore affected systems to a known secure state and validate their integrity.
* Conduct post-incident testing and verification of all systems and applications.
* Monitor for any residual threats or vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.
* Update incident response documentation based on lessons learned from the incident.

# Lessons Learned and Improvement:

* Perform a post-incident review to analyze the effectiveness of incident response activities.
* Identify lessons learned and make necessary improvements to processes, technologies, and training.
* Continuously update and enhance incident response procedures based on new threats, vulnerabilities, or regulatory requirements.

# Script that automates the alerting of key stakeholders when a security incident is detected:

import smtplib

def send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, subject, message):
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
    email_message = 'Subject: {}\n\n{}'.format(subject, message)
    server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, email_message)
    server.quit()

# Example usage
sender_email = 'indecent_response_team@example.com'
sender_password = 'indecentresponse'
recipient_email = 'recipient@example.com'
subject = 'Security Incident Detected'
message = 'Dear Stakeholders,\n\nWe have detected a security breach in our company. Please initiate the above incident response plan immediately.'
