# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* pycryptodome library (pip install pycryptodome)

# What does it do:
* This Python script demonstrates encryption and decryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in Python.

# How does it work:
* The encrypt(plaintext, key) function takes a plaintext message and a secret key as input and encrypts the message using AES in CBC (Cipher-Block Chaining) mode. 
* It returns the ciphertext and the initialization vector (IV) used for encryption.
* The decrypt(ciphertext, key, iv) function takes the ciphertext, secret key, and IV as input and decrypts the ciphertext using AES in CBC mode. 
* It returns the original plaintext.
# Usage:
* Install the required dependencies using pip install pycryptodome.
* Modify the key variable in the script with your own secret key.
* Run the script and observe the encryption and decryption process, with an example provided.

# Listed below is an example of what a succesful input/output may look like:
* Original message: Hello, world! This is a secret message.
* Decrypted message: Hello, world! This is a secret message.
